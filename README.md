# Sales-Trend-Analysis-Using-Aggregations

This project uses a basic SQL query to analyze sales trends from an online_sales table.

âœ… What This Query Does:

~ Extracts year and month from order_date

~ Calculates total revenue using SUM(amount)

~ Counts number of orders using COUNT(DISTINCT order_id)

~ Groups results by year and month to show monthly performance
